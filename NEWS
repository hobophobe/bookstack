  * Fix some unknowingly illegal destructured assignment forms

=============
Version 0.8.1
=============

  * Reworked to be a restartless add-on (including minor fixes).
  * Moved preferences to add-on page.
  * Moved the project to github. Added a readme.md for that.

=============
Version 0.7.1
=============

  * Stop using GUID to track the bookstack folder.  Hopefully this will come
  come back, as without it Bookstack doesn't play as nicely with Sync and other
  similar services.
  * Update Livemark-aware functions to use the new asynchronous service.
  * Add creation of Bookmarks, Folders, and Separators to sidebar context.
  * Rework "Add all tabs to stack" to allow an in-folder add via Shift key.

=============
Version 0.7.0
=============

  * Dropped support for Fx<4.
  * Reorder context menu to match bookmarks sidebar's more closely.
  * Made unuseful context menu items disabled rather than hidden.
  * Use a real tree for sidebar.
  * Add cut and paste abilities.
  * Removed per-button mouse settings and updated preferences dialog.
  * Eliminate trash folder to allow migration to tree-based sidebar.
  * Make opened item information stick to the tab for retrieval if cancelled.
    This allows discovering removed item in case of user-cancelled loading.
  * Added popup notifications with CSS animation as feedback for adding items.
    They simply show the animated anchor icon, no actual popups, so no item
    property editing occurs via the notifications.
  * Added shift variants for adding to stack to allow immediate editing:
    Shift+[ctrl]+middle-click on a link
    Shift+click on menu items (tab menu, content context menu)
  * Made pop (Alt+C) move the item to the bottom if it's not removed.
    This makes that action useful when the Stack is set not to remove items.
  * Fixed erroneous focusing of sidebar on application blur.
  * Fixed "Add this page" item in content area context menu when it was already
    in the stack.
  * Linux: Added icons to context menu items (for sidebar and content area).
    I don't believe the other platforms use icons in those spots, but if they
    do I will add them there too.
  * Use several more of the browser's own strings for localization.
  * Made removing the current page from the stack take place in a batch.
  * Migrated to using showBookmarkDialog for editing bookmarks.
  * Cleaned this document and renamed it to NEWS.
  * Removed .jar packing for chrome.
